<p>Readers have told me they like to build small-scale photovoltaic installations like those that power Low-tech Magazine&rsquo;s <a href="" >website</a> and <a href="" >office</a>. However, they don&rsquo;t know where to start and what components to buy. This manual brings all information together: what you need, how to wire everything together, what your design choices are, where to put solar panels, how to fix them in place (or not), how to split power and install measuring instruments. It deals with solar energy systems that charge batteries and more sustainable systems that provide direct solar power.</p>
<p>Building small-scale solar PV systems requires you to forget many things you know about conventional solar PV installations. These larger-scale systems are installed on a rooftop or in a field. They convert the low voltage diret current (DC) power produced by solar panels into high voltage alternate (AC) power for use by mains appliances, and rely on the power grid during the night and in bad weather. None of this holds for the small-scale systems we build in this manual. They are completely independent of the power grid, run entirely on low voltage power, and not aimed at powering a whole household or city but rather a specific device or a collection of them. Small-scale solar is decentralised power production taken to its extremes.</p>
<p>Most of the work in building a small-scale solar system is deciding the size of the components and the building of the supporting structure for the solar panel. Wiring is pretty straightforward, unless you want a sophisticated control panel. You only need a limited set of tools: a wire cutter, some screwdrivers (including small ones), and a wood saw are the only essentials. A soldering iron and a multimeter are handy, but you can do without them.</p>

<p>Electric power (expressed in watt) equals current (in ampère) multiplied by voltage (expressed in volt). Consequently, electric power (W) can refer to a low voltage (V) with a high current (A) or by a high voltage with a low current. Conventional solar installations for households always use an inverter, which converts the low voltage DC power from a solar panel into the high voltage AC power used by mains appliances. You can do the same for a small-scale solar installation, but it’s better to omit the inverter and build a low voltage DC solar system. That is the type of electrical installation in cars, trucks, sailboats, caravans, and motorhomes.</p>
<p>Omitting the inverter has lots of advantages. First, it makes the solar installation cheaper because inverters are expensive. Second, it makes the solar power system more energy efficient. On the one hand, converting low voltage DC power to high voltage AC power involves energy losses as high as 50% for small-scale solar installations. High quality inverters are more than 90% efficient when used at high capacity. However, if the electric load is far below the maximum capacity of an inverter, which is the case in most small-scale solar setups, the efficiency drops quickly. There is often additional energy loss (at least 5-15%) in the conversion from AC to DC power, because many modern devices operate internally on low voltage. That energy loss occurs in the AC/DC adapter of the device, which can be inside or outside.</p>

<p>High voltage AC power (220-240V in Europe, 110V in the US) results from more than a century of centralised power production. Fossil fuel power plants become more energy efficient as they get larger. Therefore, installing a few large power plants and then distributing the power over large distances across a region makes sense. Because power loss due to resistance is proportional to the square of the current, high voltages are the key to energy efficient power transmission over longer distances. Solar PV power has made this approach obsolete. Unlike a fossil fuel power plant or a wind turbine, a solar panel’s efficiency does not depend on its size. Furthermore, because solar panels can be at the point of energy consumption, there is no need to convert solar power to high voltage and transport it across large distances.</p>
<p>Directly coupling a low voltage DC device to the low voltage DC power produced by a solar panel avoids these energy losses and results in a more energy efficient system. Practically, you can power the same device with a smaller solar panel. However, this implies that you use low voltage appliances. Of course, you could plug in an inverter occasionally to power a mains appliance if there is no alternative. Make sure to buy one that is not too powerful, because it has to be operated on high capacity to be efficient. I have not found inverters with less than 150 watt power capacity.</p>

<p>The sun doesn’t always shine. That is particularly so at night. You can add a battery and charge controller to your solar PV installation. It’s the default strategy, but batteries are expensive, energy-intensive, and have short lifetimes. Across the entire life span, batteries account for 80-90% of total costs and energy invested in an off-grid solar system. They also introduce charge and discharge losses, which have to be compensated for by larger solar panels. For lead-acid batteries, the most cost-efficient option, these losses can be as high as 20-30%.</p>
<p>This manual does not argue against battery storage, which is handy for some applications. However, you can often build a photovoltaic solar installation without battery storage. Such “direct” solar systems are cheaper, quicker, and easier to make. Direct solar power works particularly well for powering devices with batteries, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, bicycle lights, portable power tools, music systems, and power banks. You can only charge these devices during the day. However, you can use them after sunset.</p>

<p>The distinction between solar panels with or without energy storage isn’t always obvious. Ifyou connect a solar panel to a USB power bank, the system becomes a battery storage system based on lithium-ion, taking advantage of the power management already available in the power bank. If you charge portable led-lights with batteries, a “direct” solar system can even keep the lights on at night – a modern approach to the torch.</p>
<p>A “direct” solar power system also allows you to use a variety of appliances during the day, even powerful ones. That includes devices that can use other forms of energy storage, such as refrigerators and cooking stoves. Part of the money saved on batteries can be spent on larger solar panels, increasing the power supply in less optimal weather. A direct solar system can thus perfectly work in cloudy weather, even if it does not work between sunset and sunrise.</p>
<h2 id="span-idcomponentswhat-you-need-the-components-of-a-small-scale-solar-systemspan"><span id="components">What you need: the components of a small-scale solar system</span></h2>
<p><strong>Solar panels</strong> are the main component of all systems we build here. Solar panels come in different voltages, usually 12V or 24V, sometimes 36V, 48V or higher for grid-tied systems. For small-scale systems, 12V or 24V is what you want, especially to start with. You can also find small solar panels with voltages below 12V.</p>
<p>People often ask which solar panels to buy, but there is little advice to give. You have a choice between mono- and polycrystalline solar panels. The first are more powerful and expensive, but there is little difference. Almost all solar panels are made in China, no matter where you buy them. A good advice is to compare prices and buy one that is not unusually cheap or expensive.</p>
<p>The other components depend on the type of installation you want to build. A solar installation with battery storage also needs a <strong>charge controller</strong> and a <strong>battery</strong>. A batteryless, direct solar system only requires a <strong>DC-DC converter</strong>. Both systems also need <strong>electric cables</strong>, <strong>fuses</strong>, and <strong>connectors</strong>. Optional components are <strong>on/off buttons</strong> and <strong>measuring devices</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="span-idwithbatteryhow-to-wire-a-solar-power-system-with-battery-storagespan"><span id="withbattery">How to wire a solar power system with battery storage?</span></h2>
<p>When building a solar power system with battery storage, you need a solar charge controller and a battery. Most off-grid solar installations run on lead-acid batteries. For portable solar systems with batteries, lithium-ion is the most practical option. Otherwise, lead-acid batteries are still the safest and most affordable option. They require less complex battery management controls than lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<h3 id="battery">Battery</h3>
<p>The type of lead-acid battery you need for a small-scale solar system is a sealed lead-acid battery. If you use a 12V solar panel, you need a 12V battery. If you use a 24V solar panel, you need a 24V battery. Handle lead-acid batteries well because not doing so can ruin them quickly. Most importantly, their voltage should not drop too much, and you should fully recharge them regularly. Never leave a lead-acid battery without charging for more than a few weeks. Keep it connected to a solar panel, including when you are away from home.</p>
<p>Think of your batteries as pets that you need to feed. Always try to keep them connected to a solar panel. Do not store them without a power source for long periods. When connected to a solar panel and battery, the charge controller will disconnect the battery when the voltage drops below a specified level, usually 12V. You can adjust this value in the menu. If you want a longer battery lifetime, you can set it to 12.2 or 12.5V, for example. The price you pay is a lower energy storage capacity.</p>

<h3 id="solar-charge-controller">Solar charge controller</h3>
<p>Never connect a solar panel directly to a battery. If you want to store solar power for later use, install a solar charge controller in between. A solar charge controller regulates the voltage output of the solar panel in function of the voltage that the battery needs during its different charging phases. It also provides a stable 12V output from the battery and shuts down the system if the voltage falls below a determined level. Most solar charge controllers offer a menu to adjust these values. Some come with a more elaborate second screen.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of different types of solar charge controllers available. For small-scale solar scale systems, my experience is that anything goes. The cheapest solar charge controllers work fine, but they should work on the correct voltage and have sufficient capacity (see how to size a solar system). More expensive solar charge controllers (like MPPT) are not worth it for small-scale systems. If your system works with lithium-ion batteries, you need a different solar charge controller, which is more expensive. If you are handy with electronics, you can build your own solar charge controller. [Link to Libre Solar and 12V book].</p>

<h3 id="wiring">Wiring</h3>
<p>Solar charge controllers connect all other components together: the battery, the solar panel, and the electric load (the devices you will power). A solar charge controller should have six wires sticking out: two to the battery, two to the solar panel, and two to the electric load. You should always connect the components in the order described below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect battery to solar charge controller (battery symbol)</li>
<li>Connect solar panel to solar charge controller (solar panel symbol)</li>
<li>Connect electric load to solar charge controller (light symbol)</li>
</ol>
<p>To disconnect, you have to go the opposite way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disconnect the electric load from the solar charge controller (light symbol)</li>
<li>Disconnect the solar panel from the solar charge controller (solar panel symbol)</li>
<li>Disconnect the battery from the solar charge controller (battery symbol)</li>
</ol>
<p>Never connect the solar panel to the charge controller if it’s not connected to the battery. Think of battery and charge controller as one unit. You can avoid costly mistakes by working on solar systems after sunset.</p>

<p>In a direct solar power system (one without a battery), there is no need for a battery or a charge controller. The solar panel is either directly connected to the powered device, or has a DC-DC converter in between. Some DC devices can work on fluctuating voltages, for example fans, pumps, and other devices with a DC motor. The motor will run faster or slower depending on the voltage. Heating elements can also work at different voltages. However, other appliances – for example all electronics – need a precise and steady input voltage. A DC-DC (buck or boost) converter is essential to keep a stable voltage output.</p>
<h3 id="dc-dc-converters">DC-DC converters</h3>
<p>A DC-DC converter is an electronic module that converts the voltage input from a solar panel into a steady voltage output for a device, for example 5V for USB-gadgets and around 20V for laptops. Most DC-DC converters are “step down” or “buck” converters – they lower the output voltage compared to the input voltage. Boost converters step up the voltage in a similar fashion. A DC-DC converter introduces energy losses, but they are smaller than the losses of inverters and AC/DC adapters.</p>

<p>For solar systems without battery storage it’s important to know that 12V solar panels actually produce more than 12V: in full sun, the voltage output will be closer to 20V. The same goes for 24V solar panels, which will have a voltage output of around 32V. The 12V or 24V indication only refers to the type of battery system you are supposed to use it for. Consequently, if you want to run 12V devices directly on a solar panel, you need a DC-DC module that converts the 20V input into a steady 12V output (unless the appliance is happy to work on different voltages). If you want to run 5V devices, you need a module that has a steady 5V output.</p>
<p>Take care to get the correct electronic module. The most versatile DC-DC converter accepts a wide range of voltages and converts these into any output voltage you want. This type of DC-DC buck converter can be directly connected to a solar panel and power all devices, no matter the voltage they run on (including 110V or 230V AC if combined with an inverter – in that case use a DC-DC converter with a 12V or 24V output because that’s the voltage input that an 12V/24V inverter needs). Such modules allow you to adjust the output voltage by turning a tiny screw. Some buck and boost converters have a small digital screen that shows the output voltage. Otherwise, use a multimeter to adjust the voltage output.</p>
<p>Other DC-DC converters need a precise voltage input, so they can only be connected to a stable voltage source, for example a 12V battery. There are also DC-DC converters with a variable voltage input but a fixed voltage output. These can be directly connected to a solar panel, but get one with a specific voltage output depending on the device you want to power. [note buck/boost]</p>
<h3 id="wiring-1">Wiring</h3>
<p>Wiring a direct solar system without battery storage is straightforward. If there is no DC-DC converter, screw the + and the – of the solar panel to the plus and the minus of the appliance. Optionally, add an on/off button. Make sure the device you power can take a fluctuating voltage.</p>
<p>If your direct solar PV system has a DC-DC converter, connect the plus and the minus of the solar panel to the plus and the minus of the DC-converter input. Next, join the plus and the minus of the DC converter output to the plus and the minus of the device. Some modules require you to solder the wires to them, while others have screws or plugs. If your DC-DC converter has a variable voltage output, you can use the solar panel for different types of appliances by turning the little screw. Alternatively, you can build a control panel to use several devices with different voltages.</p>
<h2 id="span-idsizinghow-to-size-solar-panels-batteries-and-other-componentsspan"><span id="sizing">How to size solar panels, batteries, and other components?</span></h2>
<p>All the components of a solar installation need to be dimensioned correctly in order to work together. This is much easier for a direct solar system than for a battery solar system.</p>
<h3 id="sizing-a-solar-system-without-batteries">Sizing a solar system without batteries</h3>
<p>In a direct solar system, sizing the solar panel is easy. Its maximum power production should be matched to the device(s) that you want to charge or power. However, solar panels rarely reach their maximum capacity so you should oversize the solar panel a bit. It’s a good rule of thumb to choose a solar panel with a maximum power production double the power use of the device(s) you want to connect. If you also want your direct solar installation to work in cloudy weather, you should make the panel even larger. A light cloud cover hardly has any effect on power production, while a very heavy cloud cover may stop it nearly completely. [ref]</p>
<p>If you to run a laptop directly on a solar panel, keep in mind that the laptop will require much more power when it’s charging than when it’s battery is fully charged (or when it’s operating without battery). A solar panel may be large enough to power a laptop, but not to charge it.</p>

<h3 id="sizing-a-solar-system-with-batteries">Sizing a solar system with batteries</h3>
<p>Calculating the size of a solar panel for a PV installation with battery is much more complicated – and also brings the aditional challenge of picking battery size. A solar energy system with a battery will need a larger panel to store extra energy for night and for periods of bad weather. You also need to take into account the conditions of the local climate. In less sunny climates with more seasonal differences, you need much larger panels to charge the batteries in winter. Furthermore, charging and discharging losses are as high as 20-30% in lead-acid batteries and around 10% in lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<h4 id="energy-storage-for-the-night">Energy storage for the night</h4>
<p>When sizing a solar panel for a direct solar system, you only have to look at <em>power</em> production. However, when you size a solar installation with a battery, you also have to calculate how much <em>energy</em> you need. Energy use corresponds to power multiplied by time. For example, if you want to run a 20W lighting system for 6 hours after sunset, you need 6 hours x 20 watts of power = 120 watt-hours of energy.</p>
<p>Finding the rightly sized battery and solar panel can seem tricky at first because to calculate the size of one, you need to know the size of the other, so where do you start? The best starting point is usually to determine the battery size you need. If we stick to the example above, keeping the lights on for six hours requires an energy storage of 120 watt-hours.</p>
<p>However, you cannot discharge most batteries completely. Lead-acid batteries should not drop below 50% of their maximum capacity, and for lithium-ion, that&rsquo;s 15%. If you need 120 watt-hours of storage capacity, you thus need a 240 watt-hours lead-acid battery (or a 138 Wh lithium-ion battery). Second, you should also take into account the charge and discharge losses, which add at least 20% (or 48 watt-hours) to the total, resulting in a lead-acid battery storage capacity of 288 watt-hours (10% for lithium-ion batteries, 152 Wh). To find the right battery size, you need to convert this value to ampere-hours because this is how the storage capacity of batteries is specified. For a 12V lead-acid battery, 288 watt-hours corresponds to 24 Ampere-hours (Ah) (288/12=24) battery storage capacity.</p>
<p>Now that we know the size of the battery, we can determine the size of the solar panel. At a minimum, it has to be large enough to fully charge the battery during clear weather on the shortest day of the year. That is a minimum because lead-acid batteries need a full recharge to maintain their health. If you live in an area where clouds are common, you better size the solar panel to fully charge the battery with a moderate cloud cover. If there&rsquo;s also solar energy use during the day, this adds to the total solar panel surface.</p>
<p>In the case of lead-acid batteries this calculation should start with a value only half the battery capacity. We are not discharging the lead-acid battery below 50%, so the solar panel only needs to charge 50% (or less) of the storage capacity. For example, fully charging a 288 watt-hour battery requires the solar panel to supply 144 watt-hours.</p>
<p>Then, start with a random solar panel size and see what it gives. In our example above, a 50 watt solar panel working at half of its output (25W) will produce 144 watt-hour in less than 6 hours, which sounds like it could fully charge a battery in the place where I live. In contrast, a 20 watt solar panel working at half its capacity would need 14,4 hours, which won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<h5 id="energy-storage-for-bad-weather">Energy storage for bad weather</h5>
<p>The battery storage above will only get you through the night following a full battery recharge. However, it will not be sufficient to keep the lights working in evenings if the weather during the day is working against you. To solve that, you can extend the battery storage or the solar panel surface.</p>
<p>The most energy and cost efficient option is to install more or larger solar panels and keep the battery storage capacity unchanged, because solar panels are much cheaper and less energy-intensive than batteries. As your solar panel surface gets larger, it will fully charge the battery even with a cloud cover. However, you need enough space for the extra solar panel surface, which may not always be available.</p>
<p>If you want reliability by a larger battery system,  you should multiply the required battery capacity by the number of bad weather days you need power. For example, if you need a 24 Ah battery to keep the lights working for one evening, you need a 3 x 24 Ah = 72 Ah battery to compensate for three days of no power production. That is a worst-case scenario, and you can also reduce energy demand instead of adding storage capacity by using less light or using it for a shorter time. Battery size is always a compromise between reliability on the one side and costs (both financially and energetic) on the other, so some demand side management is inevitable.</p>
<p>After you decided what battery you need, you also need to increase the solar panel surface. All those batteries need to be charged. Calculate in the same way as above.</p>
<h4 id="online-tools">Online Tools</h4>
<p>I have sized all my small-scale solar installations using back-of-the-envelope calculations as above. However, you can also use more sophisticated online calculators, <a href="re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/" >for instance this one</a>. You enter data such as your location (latitude, cloud cover) and the placement of the solar panel (orientation, tilt, periods of shading). After selecting the type of system (choose “off-grid”) and your latitude, enter the values for installed peak PV power (in Wp), battery capacity (in Wh), discharge cutoff limit (in %), energy consumption (in Wh), inclination angle of slope (in degrees) and azimuth (in degrees, the angle of the PV panel relative to the direction due South). After entering these data, you get a daily energy production estimate for all the months in the year. You can then play with the different variables to get the minimum energy production you need.</p>
