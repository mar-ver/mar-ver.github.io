<p>(This article forms part of a workshop at <a href="http://www.mad.asia/" target="_blank" >MaD 2013</a> in Hong Kong)</p>
<p>When it comes to technology, these days the East is generally known as a copycat. New technology is developed in the Western world, while the East merely copies it. Things used to be the other way around. A great deal of the technology upon which the modern world is based, comes from the East.</p>
<h2 id="part-one-shipping">Part one: shipping</h2>
<p>Take shipping, for example. Eastern sailing ships were largely superior to those used in the West. Instead of canvas sails, Asian ships used sails consisting of bamboo battens with matting stretched between them. These sails could be hauled up and down from the deck, while European sailors had to climb into the sails to furl or unfurl them whenever the wind changed. The battens also improved the aerodynamics of the sails, increasing the speed of the ship. Eastern ships were equipped with rudders, for-and-aft rigs, leeboards, watertight compartments, multiple masts and compasses since Ancient times.</p>
<p>The Chinese, especially, used huge ships to undertake sea voyages of discovery that preceded the European ones. In their heydays, around 1450, these Chinese junks were up to 150 meters long, with as many as five decks and nine masts, carrying crews of up one thousand people. This made the ships about five times the size of those used by the European explorers around the same time. The Europeans only managed to built larger ships in the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Without the importation of Eastern navigational and nautical improvements, Colombus would never have been able to sail to the Americas, and the Europeans would never have established colonial empires. Their ships were totally unfit to undertake large voyages of discovery. The square sails made it impossible to sail into the wind, while the steering oars made it difficult to control the ship in the open seas. The Europeans would not have known where to steer their ships in the first place, since they did not know the compass.</p>
<h2 id="part-two-agriculture">Part two: agriculture</h2>
<p>A similar thing happened in agriculture. Western agriculture is assumed to be the pinnacle of food production. But the European agricultural revolution, which laid the basis for the industrial revolution, was only made possible because the European copied some inportant Eastern inventions. Until two centuries ago, the West was really backward in agriculture compared to the East.</p>
<p>The most distinct advantage of Eastern agriculture was the use of efficient, iron ploughs. Because the East had a unique advantage in the working of metals - Asians were producing cast iron 1700 years before the Europeans - iron ploughs were widely available to Eastern farmers from the first century BC. The technology, which was further improved in the centuries afterwards, made it possible to work a much larger variety of soils, increasing agricultural productivity.</p>
<p>Another important consequence was that Eastern agriculture required much less draft animals. The inefficiency of European ploughs meant that large teams of 6 to 8 oxen were needed to pull them, whereas Eastern farmers could do the same job with one or two animals. This meant that the East had to leave aside much less land for grazing, so that there was more land for crops to produce food for humans.</p>
<p>The use of iron ploughs and the method of growing crops in rows were brought from the East to the West only in the 18th century. The same was true for seed drills and winnowing fans. The East was then using this technology for about 2000 ythe Chineseears. Until the eighteenth century, the Eastern agricultural system was about ten times more efficient than the European one.</p>
<h2 id="part-3-wheelbarrows">Part 3: wheelbarrows</h2>
<p>Eastern technology shows many more examples of sustainable thinking and design. Take the wheelbarrow. In the West, the wheelbarrow was a vehicle of minor importance, used for short distance cargo transport only, notably in construction, mining and agriculture. In the East, it became the <a href="/mar-ver.github.io/2011/12/how-to-downsize-a-transport-network-the-chinese-wheelbarrow/" >backbone of land transportation</a> for many centuries, carrying both cargo and passengers over medium and long distances. The Eastern wheelbarrow was of a different design than its European counterpart. By placing a large wheel in the middle of the vehicle instead of a smaller wheel in front, one could easily carry three to six times as much weight than if using a European wheelbarrow.</p>
<p>The Asian wheelbarrow could be considered the most efficient transport option over land, prior to the Industrial Revolution. It could take a load similar to that of a pack animal, yet it could be powered by humans (or even the wind - some sails used on wheelbarrows in coastal regions were as sophisticated as those on ships). Compared to a two-wheeled cart or a four-wheeled wagon, a wheelbarrow was much cheaper to build because wheel construction was a labour-intensive job. Although the wheelbarrow required a road, a very narrow path (about as wide as the wheel) sufficed, and it could be bumpy.</p>
<p>The one-wheeled vehicle appeared around the time the extensive Ancient Chinese road infrastructure began to disintegrate some 2000 years ago. Instead of holding on to carts, wagons and wide paved roads, the East turned its focus to a much more easily maintainable network of narrow paths designed for wheelbarrows, which were often driven in trains. The Europeans, faced with similar problems at the time, did not adapt their vehicles and road network and subsequently lost the option of smooth land transportation for almost one thousand years.</p>
<h2 id="part-four-dung">Part four: dung</h2>
<p>Eastern agriculture can also teach us important things when it comes to sustainability. For 4,000 years, human excrements and urine were collected and brought to the fields, where thery were applied as a fertilizer to grow food. It was transported in terracotta jars with air-tight seals, sometimes over specially designed canal networks by boats. Thanks to this method, the East kept its soil fertile and managed to feed a large population without polluting its drinking water. Meanwhile, cities in medieval Europe turned into open sewers, bringing death and disease because human excrements ended up in drinking water reserves.</p>
<p>Today, both East and West think they have solved the sanitation problem by the introduction of the water closet, and the soil fertility problem by the introduction of artificial fertilizers. However, this is not a sustainable method. Flushing the toilet turns extremely valuable resources into waste products by flushing them into the sea. Without inorganic fertilizers - without fossil fuels - our agricultural soils would lose their fertility, followed by an inevitable collapse of food production and human population. It would make a lot of sense to <a href="/mar-ver.github.io/2010/09/recycling-animal-and-human-dung-is-the-key-to-sustainable-farming/" >go back to the historic method of Eastern agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>This does not mean we have to go back to shipping human dung around the country. Rather, we could combine the idea of Eastern agriculture with modern, western technology. This is exactly what happened in the late 19th century in the Netherlands, were Charles Liernur developed a vacuum sewer system that was inspired by the Asian method of nutrient recycling. His system combined the comfort of today&rsquo;s water carriage sewer network with the ecological advantages of the earlier scavenging methods. Combining the best of East and West can lead to truly innovative and sustainable solutions.</p>
<h2 id="part-five-apply-this-knowledge-to-your-daily-life">Part five: apply this knowledge to your daily life</h2>
<p>The East should look at its own history for inspiration, instead of trying to replace their ingenious designs by inefficient Western ones, such as artificial fertilizers, or cars and trucks. A sustainable transport system, for example, will be built on small and light vehicles, of which the East has many. Improving them by the use of modern Western technology, such as electric motors, raises many possibilities. The East should find back its innovative spirit, but it should also be creative in combining the best of East and West, just as the Europeans did in the last 300 years.</p>
<p>The Europeans copied the iron plough and the ships of the Asians, but after that they further improved these technologies. The East could do the same with the Western technology that it is adopting now. And there is a lot to improve, because the great disadvantage of contemporary western technology is its unsustainability: it goes together with pollution and with high energy and material consumption.</p>
<p>There are many more examples of superior Eastern technology, and it would take me days or even weeks to talk about them all. Besides, this is your history of technology, not mine. There exist good books in English. But many more forgotten technologies must be hidden in the extensive literature written in Asian languages, online and in libraries. We need people like you to research them. And books are not the only sources of knowledge. Many older people still remember technology that most of us have forgotten about. Your grandparents might have the clues to a sustainable society.</p>
<p>A good example of this is the work made by Korean artist <a href="http://www.notechmagazine.com/2012/01/saving-food-from-the-fridge.html" target="_blank" >Jihyun Ryou</a>. While listening to her grandmother and other elderly, she found out about a traditional way of storing food that she translated into a contemporary design that <a href="http://www.notechmagazine.com/2012/01/saving-food-from-the-fridge.html" target="_blank" >eliminates the need for a refrigerator</a>.</p>
